Everything after this line is verbatim from the dryad submission above:


Variables used:
"year" = year of the breeding season
"hd" = hatching date (day 1= 1st of May)
"cs" = clucth size
"fledg" = number of fledgling
"LVspr" = spring vole abundance (log scale)        
"LVfal" = previous autumn vole abundance (log)
"Builtup_200" = % of builtup areas at 200m from the focal pygmy owl nest
"Farmlands_1000" = % of farmlands at 1000m
"OS_700" = % of old spruce forest at 700m
"MP_900" = % of mature pine forest at 900m   
"OP_2500" = % of old pine at 2500m
"NNPO" = distance to the nearest active nest of pygmy owl
"NNTO" = distance to the nearest active nest of Tengmlam's owl
"POdens_500" = density of active nest of pygmy owl (with a sigma=500m, see methods)
"POdens_3000" = density of active nest of pygmy owl (with a sigma=3000m, see methods)  
"TOdens_500" =  density of active nest of Tengmlam's owl (with a sigma=500m, see methods)
"TOdens_3000" = density of active nest of Tengmalm's owl (with a sigma=3000m, see methods)

Except for year, hd, cs and fledg, all variables are scaled (~z-score) following Schielzeth 2010, Methods in Ecology and Evolution.
The landscape variables and both pygmy owl (PO) and Tengmalm's owl (TO) densities are presented at the spatial range that best explained occupation and breeding success of pygmy owls (see methods)

P.S.: due to the sensitivity of these species to disturbance and their conservation status, we are not able to provide the locations of all available breeding sites nor the coordinates of active nests
