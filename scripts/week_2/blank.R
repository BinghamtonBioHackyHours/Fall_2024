# first we need to read in the data




# look at the structure


# dimensions of the data?



# so there are 480 observations of 12 variables

# looks like there are 4 categorical variables we might be interested in, let's see how 
# many observations are in each of them



# since we are probably looking for an affect of generation and treatment, how many
# are in each combination of generation and treatment





# it looked like there were some columns 
# that had NAs, let's see how many NAs are in each column



# looks like there is a lot of missing data! 

# let's take a look at the total biomass column




# seems there is a big spike at 0, what does it look like if we remove those



# we often think about size in terms of log size, let's log it!



# we will assume if total biomass = 0 that the plant did not germinate, what is the
# proportion of plants that germinated




# not great, does it seem like there is a difference between the generations?
# the treatments?



# how many entries have root and vegetative masses but no floral mass?



# what is the proportion of germinated seeds that grew flowers?



# is the germination rate different between generations in each treatment
